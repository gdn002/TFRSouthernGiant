		# Notes on how the dynamic idea magic is done for reference
		# Modifiers are actually applied via a dynamic modifier by tweaking its variables to change the effects
		# In order to get the "modify idea" tooltip, a series of dummy ideas are made with the effective changes as their modifier block
		# Then, effect_tooltip can be used to spoof the tooltip by fake swapping the blank dummy idea with the respective dummy change idea
		# This is my first proper HOI4 mod project and I figured this shit out, kudos me
