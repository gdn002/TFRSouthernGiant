 Brazil.commie.1.t: "The Brazilian Popular Front Rises!"
 Brazil.commie.1.d: "The Brazilian Popular Front was formed from the unlikely union of Brazil's many socialist and communist parties under the revolutionary banner of the Popular Unity party. Created as a response to the Bolsonaro administration and encroaching reactionary thought in the country, our movement aimed to present a strong united opposition front from the far-left.\nWhile we initially conceded to the much more popular Worker's Party in backing Lula in the 2022 elections, the collapse of the Brazilian government has led them to show their true colors as they would rather align with the burgeouise elites in trying to uphold a failed establishment rather than take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally give power back to the Brazilian worker.\nSo the responsibility falls onto us. As the despots and the elites fight over the carcass of the old country, we will unite the Brazilian workers. We will strengthen our vanguard. And when the time is right, we shall liberate Brazil!"
 Brazil.commie.1.a: "O povo, unido, jamais será vencido!"
 Brazil.commie.2.t: "The Factions of The Worker's Council"
 Brazil.commie.2.d: "With the formation of a provisional socialist government in Salvador, it was inevitable that the old party and ideological divisions would come up once again. While the consensus in the council seems to be to set these differences aside and focus on consolidating the revolution, in practice three factions have formed in the ruling body, each with their own beliefs and sets of plans for how the new Brazilian nation should be organized.\n\nThe §dHardliners§! are a faction formed from members of the PCO and has attracted the more radical and reactionary members of the council. They advocate for a totalitarian state where socialism is enforced from the top down, denounce progressive ideals such as the LGBTQ+ movement as \"Western degeneracy\" and are firm adherents of Trotskyist Internationalism, pushing for the eventual unification of all of Latin America under a single socialist state.\n\nThe §ACentrists§! are currently the most influential faction, formed from a coalition of Marxist-Leninist parties such as PCB, PCdoB and most of UP. They advocate for a pragmatic approach to nation building following in the steps of actually existing socialist states such as the former USSR and the PRC. While they embrace progressive causes, they also call for a sovereign approach to progressivism, denouncing its more imperialist forms as often wielded by the US and Europe.\n\nThe §tLibertarians§! have formed mostly from PSOL constituents, beign the least radical faction in the council. While they still fight for the overcoming of capitalism in Brazil, they believe that the republican democratic system isn't inherently bad, and advocate for the reform of the existing political system paired with a new strong socialist constitution. They are also the most progressive of the three factions, putting many such movements in the forefront of their cause."
 Brazil.commie.2.a: "We may have our differences, but we are united behind a common goal!"
 Brazil.commie.3.t: "Our Strategy in The Impending Conflict"
 Brazil.commie.3.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.3.a: "We shall dig in and hold our ground."
 Brazil.commie.3.b: "We shall move fast and erratically to confuse the enemy."
 Brazil.commie.3.c: "We shall exploit openings and counter-attack whenever possible."
 Brazil.commie.4.t: "The Convict Question"
 Brazil.commie.4.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.4.a: "Offer suspension of sentences in exchange for conscription."
 Brazil.commie.4.b: "Offer suspension of sentences in exchange for labor."
 Brazil.commie.4.c: "Suspend the sentences of petty criminals for no cost."
 Brazil.commie.4.e: "Do we really want convicts roaming around?"
 Brazil.commie.5.t: "Army Brigades Join Our Cause!"
 Brazil.commie.5.d: "Great news for the revolution today, as two major army headquarters have revolted against the Brazilian high command and joined our cause. The 7th and 10th motorized brigades had initially entrenched themselves in their respective headquarters and refused to comply with orders to break their encirclement and link up with the rest of the Brazilian Army. Last night, a mutiny was spearheaded by the soldiers, leading to the purging of officers sympathetic to [BR2.GetNameDef] and the complete cutting of communications with the central command. Today, the two brigades have contacted the revolutionary command and expressed their desire to fight on our side.\nThe message has been delivered by general Miranda Netto, whom has sided with the mutiny. According to the general, the revolutionary messages of the Popular Front have reverberated amongst the grunts, combined with a sense of Northeastern patriotism which has led to the mutiny. The general has expressed a desire to reform the Popular Front's guerrilas into a semi-professional army with the help of his army expertise.\nWhile many celebrate this as a turning point in the Brazilian revolution, some remain skeptical about bringing in former members of the Brazilian Army into our forces, afraid that Miranda Netto could be secretly plotting against our movement."
 Brazil.commie.5.a: "A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!"
 Brazil.commie.6.t: "The Amazonian Commune Calls For Our Aid!"
 Brazil.commie.6.d: "With the recent enemy incursions into the Northern territories, representatives of the native insurgency have contacted the leaders of the Popular Front offering a joint effort to combat the opposing forces. The insurgency is sympathetic to the revolutionary ideals of the front, and has shown willingness to fight by our side in order to defeat the fascists and oligarchs to our South.\nOur strategic command has discussed the potential advantages and disadvantages of this alliance. On one side, it would give us a major ally and allow us to catch our enemies off-guard as they're currently bogged down in the jungle. On the other side, concerns about the Popular Front's fighting forces possibly not being prepared for a massive counter-offensive have been raised. Ultimately, a consensus has been made:"
 Brazil.commie.6.a: "The revolution has a duty to protect the native peoples of Brazil."
 Brazil.commie.6.b: "This move would jeopardize the movement right now."
 Brazil.commie.7.t: "The Final Act"
 Brazil.commie.7.d: "This is it. The revolution has entered its last act. The fascists and their army in Brasília have been crushed, the corrupt oligarchs and their police force in Rio have scattered away. No more masters, no more emperors, no more oppressors, just the common Brazilian worker in control of their own destiny for the first time in history.\nStill, not all Brazilians have gotten the memo yet. The states to the South cling onto an old status quo that no longer exists, and all over the country there are people who have not yet reckognized the people's mandate."
 Brazil.commie.7.a: "The revolution is almost over!"
 Brazil.commie.8.t: "Popular Front Demands Amazonian Reintegration"
 Brazil.commie.8.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.8.a: "We trust the leadership of the Popular Front."
 Brazil.commie.8.b: "Our sovereignty is non-negotiable!"
 Brazil.commie.9.t: "The Amazonian Commune Agrees to Reintegrate!"
 Brazil.commie.9.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.9.a: "We are stronger together."
 Brazil.commie.10.t: "The Amazonian Commune Refuses to Reintegrate!"
 Brazil.commie.10.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.10.a: "Unfortunately, we cannot let this stand."
 Brazil.commie.11.t: "Popular Front Issues Ultimatum!"
 Brazil.commie.11.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.11.a: "We have no choice but to comply..."
 Brazil.commie.11.b: "These insurrectionists have no mandate!"
 Brazil.commie.12.t: "The State of São Paulo Rejoins The Union!"
 Brazil.commie.12.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.12.a: "They made the correct choice."
 Brazil.commie.13.t: "The State of São Paulo Defies Us!"
 Brazil.commie.13.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.13.a: "Then we shall drive our tanks down Faria Lima street!"
 Brazil.commie.14.t: "Popular Front Challenges Our Independence!"
 Brazil.commie.14.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.14.a: "For our own sake, our experiment must end here."
 Brazil.commie.14.b: "The South is our country and we shall fight for it!"
 Brazil.commie.15.t: "Southern Brazil Submits!"
 Brazil.commie.15.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.15.a: "The rebel region is pacified."
 Brazil.commie.16.t: "Southern Brazil Demands Independence"
 Brazil.commie.16.d: ""
 Brazil.commie.16.a: "Then it shall be liberated too!"
 Brazil.commie.17.t: "On Revolutionary Optimism"
 Brazil.commie.17.d: "It is said that Vladimir Lenin assumed he would not live to see a communist revolution take place in Russia. In the 20th century, the main name behind Brazilian communism had been Luís Carlos Prestes, a pioneer who witnessed the rise of the Soviet Union, provided a front against the rise of evil in Brazil, and for all his sacrifices, he unfortunately did not live to see the day the Brazilian workers would rise up in the first step to overcome the evils of capitalism in his country.\nBut being a communist is not merely about improving one's condition. It is about believing in the good of human nature, it is about hoping that a better society is always possible, it is about fighting for the common good even if you know you might not live to see the fruits of your labor.\nPrestes did not live to see the day the Brazilian people would decide enough was enough and break from their shackles, but we are unfathomably lucky to be witness to it. And with our enemies defeated, the country reunited under popular rule and jubilation all across Brazil, our liberation is all but inevitable. This is a victory for us, for every Brazilian that has lived and will live, for the workers of the world... This is a victory for Prestes."
 Brazil.commie.17.a: "A better future is possible."

 BR3_cw_mount_a_workers_council_desc: "If we intend to be more than just a bunch of anarquists, we must assemble a functional government.

 BR3_cw_link_up_with_pf_cells_desc: "The Popular Front is rising throughout all of the Brazilian Northeast! It is critical that we establish a network between local councils and are able to operate as a de facto state if we intend to stand a chance against the opposing factions to the South."

 BR3_guerrila_media_desc: "Socialist media tactics have changed a lot in the 21st century. While traditional media such as newspapers still cling onto some relevancy, most people these days turn to their smartphones for their media consumption, and we must keep up with the times if we want to win the hearts and minds of the population. Fortunately, the Brazilian online space is full of talented socialist content creators just a boost away from becoming the next Pravda."
 BR3_brazilian_vanguard: "The Brazilian Vanguard"
 BR3_brazilian_vanguard_desc: "Every successful socialist revolution needs a vanguard party, a serious movement that is able to rally the support of the population and rally them to fight for their own rights. The Brazilian proletariat has been denied a true vanguard movement for decades, left helpless by encroaching neoliberalism. It is our responsibility as a revolutionary coalition to fill in this gap and show to the Brazilians that our project for the nation not only is serious, but is what's the best for everyone."
 BR3_seize_the_means_of_production: "Seize The Means of Production!"
 BR3_seize_the_means_of_production_desc: "As our revolution has taken hold of Northeastern Brazil, the capital owning class has predictably fled with its tail between its legs and taken as much of their wealth with them as they could. But no matter how hard they tried, they could not hope to take our farms, factories and other means of production. They belong to the Brazilians!"
 BR3_rally_the_workers: "Rally The Workers"
 BR3_rally_the_workers_desc: "Unlike these lazy liberals and fascists, us communists actually want to work! We want to work under dignified conditions, not for the sake of enriching some suit, but for ourselves! There's plenty of work to be done if we are to consolidate this revolution, and convincing the Brazilian people to pick up the slack will be difficult, but all they need is to experience the fruits of unalienated labor to ignite the flame!"
 BR3_civilian_industry: "Focus On Civilian Production"
 BR3_civilian_industry_desc: "The Brazilian people have already suffered enough, and our movement should be about helping them first and foremost. We shall direct our production efforts towards affordable consumer goods and services and ease the burden of the civil war on the population. Besides, by caring for our people, we show them what they have to lose."
 BR3_revolutionary_industry: "Fire Up The Revolutionary Industry"
 BR3_revolutionary_industry_desc: "Sometimes you must make short-term sacrifices for long-term gains. Right now, we must secure the Brazilian revolution by any means necessary, or risk losing everything we've fought so much for. Our production efforts shall be directed away from more lavish goods and towards supplies for the revolution. The Brazilians have endured frugality for so long, they can afford to do so just a while longer for a greater cause."

 #Ideas
 BR3_popular_front_idea: "Popular Front"
 BR3_popular_front_idea_desc: "While we may have disagreements on the exact method, the many parties and peoples of the Brazilian Popular Front all share the same objective: To depose the corrupt Brazilian burgeouise elites and install a government truly of the people, for the people. While there will be time for political discussion and faction bickering after the dust settles, right now our people are dominated by an uncontested revolutionary fervor that spreads to workers throughout Brazil!\n\n§RNow or never, Brazil will be red!§!"
 BR3_counter_revolution_idea: "Counter Revolution"
 BR3_disorganized_warfare_idea: "Disorganized Warfare"
 BR3_disorganized_warfare_idea_desc: "Nobody was expecting a revolutionary war to be a dinner party, but we still should abide by some standards. Our primary forces are currently comprised of poorly organized militias that are barely indistinguishable from organized crime gangs. If we expect to hold our own against the Brazilian army, we will need to establish doctrines and rules of engagement, as well as train our fighters so they're ready for anything."
 BR3_guerrila_warfare_idea: "Guerrila Warfare"
 BR3_guerrila_warfare_idea_desc: "Our militias have evolved from a disorganized rabble into a competent fighting force, able to engage and sustain in guerrila warfare. Such tactics enable us to hold the line against the enemy for now, but we will need to establish a semi-professional army if we expect to devise and execute the tactics required to go on the offensive and liberate all of Brazil."
 BR3_liberation_army_idea: "Brazilian Liberation Army"
 BR3_liberation_army_idea_desc: "Thanks to extensive training programs and combat experience, our fighters not only are able to counter enemy tactics, but also devise their own. The old Brazilian high command is full of soft old men who landed a cushy job and never had to ever think about the reality of battle. Our Liberation Army has been forged from scratch in fire and fury and has become hardened as a result, having what it takes to push back against the enemy."
 BR3_uncontrolled_industrial_output_idea: "Uncontrolled Industrial Output"
 BR3_uncontrolled_industrial_output_idea_desc: "The labor force in our farms and factories is in chaos. This comes at no surprise, as the capital owners have fled to other parts of the country or abroad, leaving our workers without directions. We must seize the means of production and restart our industrial base, not with profit in mind, but for the good of the common people!"
 BR3_redirected_industrial_output_idea: "Redirected Industrial Output"
 BR3_redirected_industrial_output_idea_desc: "The means of production are finally ours! Without the capital owning class in our way, we've been able to assume direct control of our industrial capabilities, and make it the most efficient it has ever been. Our workers toil no longer for the profit of the burgeoise, but for the revolution!"
