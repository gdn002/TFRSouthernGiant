 Brazilnews.1.t: "Supreme Court Overturns Lula's Convictions"
 Brazilnews.1.d: "Brazil's Supreme Court minister Edson Fachin has overturned today all convictions imposed by the Federal Justice of Paraná on ex-president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva. The ex-president had been condemned on charges of corruption and money laundering in 2018 as part of Brazil's \"Car Wash\" anti-corruption investigations, which resulted in the suspension of his presidential campaign in the same year and his imprisonment. Fachin argued that there was not enough proof to form a conclusive case linking Lula to the fiscal irregularities that were under investigation, and also cited an abnormal assignment of judge Sérgio Moro to the case, who's been considered biased in the case. The overturn passed with 8 votes against 3 in the Supreme Court.\n\nLula, who had spent 580 days in prison and was released in early 2019 under claims of his arrest being inconstitutional, said in a press interview that he had always been certain of his innocence, that he was confident in the Brazilian process, and that \"the truth would win in the end\". The decision has proven controversial in Brazil's political and popular spheres, with many cheering the ex-president's release and claiming that justice has been done, while others condemn the decision and claim that Lula is still a criminal. Regardless, the decision restore Lula's political rights and means he would be allowed to run for the Brazilian office again."

 Brazilnews.2.t: "Manaus Fills Mass Graves as Covid-19 Hits The Amazon"
 Brazilnews.2.d: "As the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil worsens, a grim sight has taken place in the Amazonian city of Manaus. Around 300 bodies of Covid victims have been laid to rest in an improvised mass grave in the middle of the jungle. According to local authorities, the deathcare systems in the municipality have been overburdened by the sudden spike in fatalities.\n\nLocal citizens have been appaled at the development as they witness their friends and family buried en masse. \"They were just dumped there like dogs\" - said local Gabriel de Oliveira, whose spouse contracted the disease during a hospital procedure - \"What are our lives worth now? Nothing?\".\n\nManaus's mayor, Arthur Virgílio, has pleaded the international community for help. \"We aren't in a state of emergency... We're well beyond that\"."

 Brazilnews.4.t: "Lula da Silva Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.4.d: "With around 98% of votes tallied in the recent Brazilian 2022 general elections, Worker's Party candidate Luís Inácio Lula da Silva has been certified as the newest president elect of Brazil. This marks a historic moment in the country's political history, as Lula is the first Brazilian to be elected thrice as president. Reactions in the country have been split, with more progressive-minded Brazilians feeling ecstatic about their victory over the incumbent right-wing administration.\n\nIn a speech to his voters, Lula has thanked them and stated that his administration would see a return to the values of social democracy that led to Brazil's ascension in the 2000s and reaffirming that he cared for every Brazilian, regardless of ideological alignment.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle however, reactionary citizens and politicians have thus far refused to concede the results, claming that the electronic voting machines used in the elections were targeted by hackers in order to switch votes to Lula. Local analysts have expressed concern over the reaction to the elections, pointing to the ongoing crisis in the United States and warning of a possible similar development happening in Brazil."

 Brazilnews.5.t: "Geraldo Alckmin Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.5.d: "The recent general elections in Brazil have resulted in a major upset, as centrist candidate Geraldo Alckmin has been confirmed winner, marking the return of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party to power after two decades. This has come as a shock to both many Brazilians and international observers, as all signs pointed to it being a fierce contest between progressives and reactionaries, with PSDB candidate Alckmin expected to maintain a solid third place.\n\nWhile analysts believe this could represent a desire of the Brazilian people to stay away from more extreme politics in an ever more unstable world, some also point out at Alckmin's connections with the Brazilian establishment and media conglomerates as a major force behind his campaign and subsequent victory.\n\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians seem content with this result, those at the fringes have refused to concede defeat, accusing Alckmin's campaign of being unfairly backed by Brazilian elites and engaging in corrupt tactics in order to win. The international community has expressed concern with this development, as it could mirror the recent US political crisis that resulted in a continental civil war in the country."

 Brazilnews.6.t: "Jair Bolsonaro Re-Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.6.d: "As the general elections in Brazil come to a close, it has been confirmed that incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro has secured his re-election. The right-wing conservative has had a troubled last two years in office, as Covid-19 ravaged Brazil, paired with the effects of the international oil crisis and also accusations of conspiracy. This culminated in 2021's \"Covid Trials\", where Bolsonaro was put to trial.\n\nHowever, the elections have proven that these events did little to damage Bolsonaro's or the right's reputation in the country, as the Brazilians have chosen for the continuation of his administration. In a speech to his followers, Bolsonaro proclaimed that he intends to make up for lost time and finish the project he started in 2018.\n\nOn the progressive side of Brazilian politics, accusations have been flung towards Bolsonaro wielding administrative powers to supress voters, specially in areas known to vote frequently for the Worker's Party. Analysts warn of a potential sucession crisis not unlike what has been witnessed in the US leading up to a complete civil war."

 Brazilnews.7.t: "[?BRA.BRA_2022_elections_bolsonaro_candidate_token.GetTokenLocalizedKey] Elected in Brazil!"
 Brazilnews.7.d: "Interesting development today, as Brazilian authorities have confirmed the victory of candidate [?BRA.BRA_2022_elections_bolsonaro_candidate_token.GetTokenLocalizedKey] in the 2022 general elections. Current president Jair Bolsonaro has recently been the target of several investigations around his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as political conspiracy, culminating in last year's \"Covid Trials\" and a severe loss in ratings for the incumbent.\n\nJair's son [?BRA.BRA_2022_elections_bolsonaro_candidate_token.GetTokenLocalizedKey] was picked to run in his place in the elections, and while analysts had projected the newcomer candidate to come short of his father, the results have proven that Bolsonaro's project still holds, even without Jair in the presidential chair.\n\nBrazil's progressive wing has called out the candidature however, accusing [?BRA.BRA_2022_elections_bolsonaro_candidate_token.GetTokenLocalizedKey] of being merely a stand-in for Jair, who allegedly plans to govern as a shadow president through his son. Left-wing protests are being organized around the country, bringing fears of a repeat of the recent US political crisis and resulting conflict."

 Brazilnews.8.t: "Brazilian Republic Breaks Down"
 Brazilnews.8.d: "Following a recent overreach of the Brazilian military as it contained an insurrection attempt in Brazil's Federal District, armed conflict has been reported in the country's central regions. The insurrection developed from a series of riots against the results of the country's recent presidential elections, which escalated into bomb threats and the overruning of government buildings in the capital city of Brasília. The Brazilian Army moved in to secure the Federal District and enacted a state of siege, prompting centrist and progressive politicians to refuse travelling to the capital and instead forming an emergency government under a Lula-Alckmin coalition in the city of Rio de Janeiro, while Jair Bolsonaro and the military took over the seat of the former government.\n\nWith the collapse of the Brazilian government, several regions of the country have declared their own sovereign authorities. Most notably, the Northeastern region of Brazil has been taken over by the \"Brazilian Popular Front\", a coalition of left-wing parties that seek to overthrow the other two rival governments and unite Brazil under a new socialist state.\n\nMany see this as the latest chapter of the after-effects of the US Civil War, which has also led to similar collapses in Mexico and Colombia, as well as a widespread conflict in Central America. International authorities have expressed intention in sending humanitarian aid to the South American nation in crisis, but already find their supply lines stretched thin between the conflict in the USA, other conflicts throughout the world and tensions within their own local spheres."
