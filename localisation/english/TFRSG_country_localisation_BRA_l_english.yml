 Brazil.1.t: "The Forever Country of The Future"
 Brazil.1.d: "Brazil is described by many things. Soccer. Carnaval. Sunny beaches, favelas and corruption. But perhaps the best way to describe Brazil is the moniker of \"Country of The Future\". Thirty-five years ago, the military regime that had haunted us for two decades had finally thawed, and the Sixth Brazilian Republic was born. While this republic had a bumpy ride at first, compensating for the shortfalls wrought by the dictatorship years and worldwide financial instability, we managed to arrive into the new millennium mostly in one piece.\nWith the new millennium, came new challenges, new ways of thinking, and new opportunities. The global commodities boom combined with the Worker's Party developmentalist policies put us on the road to becoming the country of the future. But our bloated, corrupt establishment slowed us down, and before we could live up to the hype, the boom was over and with it so was the dream.\nSo the Brazilian people called for change, and did it come. The new administration is the complete antithesis to what came before, exchanging developmentalism for austerity and progressivism for tradition. But so far, it has been more of the same with a different coat of paint. Brazil's issues run deeper than what a mere political party switch can solve. If we really want to live up to the hype, we'll need to fight the root cause of our problems, or otherwise be doomed to be the forever country of the future."
 Brazil.1.a: "És belo, és forte, impávido colosso, e o teu futuro espelha essa grandeza."
 Brazil.2.t: "Everything Going to Plan"
 Brazil.2.d: "It is often joked that the Brazilian year does not start proper until after the Carnaval, and as summer finally comes to a close the Brazilian people prepare to go back to their usual lives in the new decade. But within the Palácio do Planalto, the Brazilian presidential palace, the first few weeks of 2020 have been ones of intense discussions. In particular, the same question that every elected president always had at some point in their career could not leave Jair Bolsonaro's mind: What's the problem with Brazilian politics?\nSurely if you asked him, the answer would seem obvious - the Worker's Party and their corruption. But they were out of the picture now, and it was Bolsonaro's time to shine. And yet, it seemed that they hadn't moved forward an inch. The socialists, the liberals, even the military, they all had their shot at handling things and yet they all fell short. Was his own project fated to the same outcome?\nEven though Bolsonaro refused to fully admit, deep down he knew that the issue ran deeper than just mere ideology. It was the establishment itself that had held everyone back for so long. Self-serving interests running everything from the shadows and keeping a puppet show in Brasília. You either played to the tune, or you'd be discarded, like happened with Dilma.\n\nBut what if he could be the one to finally cut the strings and become a true sovereign leader?"
 Brazil.2.a: "We have our work cut out for us."
 Brazil.3.t: "The Repatriation of Brazilian Citizens in Wuhan"
 Brazil.3.d: "With the reports of a novel coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan comes the question of what to do with the Brazilian nationals that happen to find themselves stranded right in the epicenter of the outbreak. The Brazilian Air Force has charted a plan to repatriate the Brazilian citizens, who will be tested for the disease and put in quarantine for 18 upon arrival on national soil. However, with the infection and death toll in China rapidly spreading and commercial airlines around the world beginning to cancel flights, the concern of this repatriation potentially speeding up the spread of the coronavirus to Brazil has been raised."
 Brazil.3.a: "Our thoughts and prayers shall be with them."
 Brazil.3.b: "Send in the airforce! Nobody left behind!"
 Brazil.4.t: "The Political Tit-for-Tat"
 Brazil.4.d: "Brazilian politics, like every other republic under the sun, is a game of give and take. However, the legislative branch in particular is very keen on the taking part. Since it is rare that a majority of senators and deputies can ever reasonably agree on something, the Brazilian political process seems to be in a perpetual state of deadlock - that is, until someone can come in and grease the wheels.This was a problem for Bolsonaro, who built his campaign under promises of fighting PT's corruption only to find itself needing to engage into the same practices to get anything done.\nPart of him felt tempted to just give into this status quo, let the legislative have its way while he sat comfortably in power - after all, they were not ones to bite the hand that would feed them. But doing so would mean betraying his ideals and the promises he had made to the Brazilian people. There had to be another way, a way to keep this political rabble in line and get them to sing to his tune.\n\nPerhaps it was time to get self-interest out of government, and replace it with a cohesive ideology."
 Brazil.4.a: "Turns out, being a president is hard work."
 Brazil.5.t: "Reshuffling the Cabinet"
 Brazil.5.d: "Fill our cabinet with loyalists..."
 Brazil.5.a: "A clean up of our administration has been long overdue."
 Brazil.6.t: "Discharging the Federal Police Director"
 Brazil.6.d: "Maurício Valeixo gets discharged..."
 Brazil.6.a: "Swap him! And if you can't, swap his chief!"
 Brazil.7.t: "Justice Minister Sérgio Moro Quits!"
 Brazil.7.d: "The judge had enough..."
 Brazil.7.a: "He was all but another rat."
 Brazil.8.t: "Bolsonaro Breaks Quarantine to Rally Up Base"
 Brazil.8.d: "He's not very careful..."
 Brazil.8.a: "At least he didn't shake hands with anyone?"
 Brazil.9.t: "Discussing Government Positions With The Centrão"
 Brazil.9.d: "Just a few key positions couldn't hurt?"
 Brazil.9.a: "Centrão above all?"
 Brazil.10.t: "Centrist in Charge of Government"
 Brazil.10.d: "Ricardo Barros is in charge of our government..."
 Brazil.10.a: "The centrão always wins."
 Brazil.11.t: "First Covid-19 Cases Diagnosed in Brazil"
 Brazil.11.d: "The Health Ministry has confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus infection in Brasil, a 61 year old man living in São Paulo recently arrived from a trip to Italy. This marks not only the first case in Brazil, but also all of Latin America. According to health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the patient arrived to the country without symptoms and sought health services a few days later with respiratory symptoms. 30 other people that have been in contact with him have also been put under observation. Other passengers of Air France flight AF 454 will not be quarantined, but those that were in close proximity to the patient will also be put under observation.\nMandetta has advised that those with symptoms should avoid travelling for the time being, and inform authorities upon arrival if symptoms arise. Besides this case, at least 20 other patients in the country are currently under investigation for the coronavirus infection."
 Brazil.11.a: "Everything will be under control."
 Brazil.12.t: "Bolsonaro Acknowledges Covid-19 Outbreak"
 Brazil.12.d: "With Covid-19 cases rapidly spreading throughout the country and even several cases resulting in deaths, president Jair Bolsonaro has finally acknowledged the outbreak in his most recent statement. However, to the despair of healthcare workers and his own health ministry, Bolsonaro has criticized requests for self-isolation and early quarantine measures, calling it a \"fearmongering media campaign\" and referring to the disease as \"nothing more than a little flu\". Bolsonaro also boasted about his alleged \"athlete background\" protecting him from the worst symptoms should he get infected.\nThe president's stance has led to discussions behind closed doors with the health minister Henrique Mandetta, who called for lockdowns to contain the spread. It seems that Bolsonaro's plans have no room for Covid-19 measures, but perhaps some actions could be taken under the table..."
 Brazil.12.a: "But it won't get that bad, right?"
 Brazil.13.t: "Emergency Covid Welfare Fund"
 Brazil.13.d: "President Jair Bolsonaro has sanctioned today a law establishing a monthly emergency fund of R$ 600 for three months to informal workers. The goal of this fund is to dampen the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the income of such workers, who lack the protections of formalized employment. The fund is expected to benefit 54 million Brazilians. Although Bolsonaro has already signed the law, he will be withhelding its publication so long as provisions are taken to indicate the credit source of the fund, which is estimated to cost around R$ 100 billion."
 Brazil.13.a: "It's not much, but every little bit counts."
 Brazil.14.t: "Extending the Emergency Covid Welfare Fund"
 Brazil.14.d: "The emergency Covid-19 fund sanctioned 3 months ago has proven to be a lifeline for many Brazilians under precarious employment conditions, as the Covid-19 pandemic has directly impacted their income. The initially established duration for the fund is nearing its end, but with the pandemic showing no signs of letting down anytime soon, talks of extending it are being had. While extending the fund would mean further relief to the Brazilian working class and potentially higher ratings for the administration, it would also mean going way beyond the budget that had been initially agreed upon for the fund. Bolsonaro has offered a compromise solution of cutting the fund by half for the extension, from R$ 600 to 300 monthly. Ultimately, it is up to him to sanction or veto the extension."
 Brazil.14.a: "The Brazilian people need every penny."
 Brazil.14.b: "The current value is too high for the country."
 Brazil.14.c: "We're about done handing out freebies."
 Brazil.15.t: "Dealing With Henrique Mandetta"
 Brazil.15.d: "Bye bye"
 Brazil.15.a: "It was a consensual divorce."
 Brazil.16.t: "The Oil Crisis Hits Brazil!"
 Brazil.16.d: "Brazilians have woken up to skyrocketing fuel prices and gigantic lines at gas stations today, as the effects of the Saudi collapse are felt in the country. With around 20% of the country's fuel imports coming from Saudi Arabia, and another 15% from the US, a third of the nation's gas sources have been compromised, leading to shortages across the country.\nWhile Brazil does extract enough oil to be considered self-sufficient, it lacks the oil refining capabilities to make use of these reserves, relying on imports to maintain its fuel reserves. While the international situation has boosted our gains from exports, they have been completely offset by these import costs, leaving us at a net loss.\nAnalysts warn that the fuel shortages could lead to further political instability in the country."
 Brazil.16.a: "Let's hope they have some extra reserves at Petrobrás..."
 Brazil.17.t: "Brazilian Covid Cases Skyrocket"
 Brazil.17.d: "We can't control it anymore."
 Brazil.17.a: "It is our problem as well now."
 Brazil.18.t: "Senator Calls For Parliamentary Inquiry Into Covid-19"
 Brazil.18.d: "Actions have consequences..."
 Brazil.18.a: "Just the opposition kicking up a stir."
 Brazil.19.t: "Covid Parliamentary Inquiry Commitee Installed"
 Brazil.19.d: "Huh this is really happening."
 Brazil.19.a: "Can't we have a break? I'm trying to govern here!"
 Brazil.20.t: "The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies"
 Brazil.20.d: "Every president in the Sixth Brazilian Republic, be it left, right or center, must deal with the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, where the elected representatives of the Brazilian people gather to discuss and vote on projects. This is no different for Jair Bolsonaro: while his coalition and allies have managed to secure a sizable portion of the chamber in the 2018 elections, it still hasn't been enough to secure a majority, as it has ever been for any president.\nAs we cannot rely solely on our allies, we have to engage with the neutral factions in the chamber: the centrists, or \"Centrão\" as they've come to be called. With some well-placed persuasion, we can secure their support for our causes, however we must also be careful about not letting their influence get too high to the point they can obstruct our policies.\nIn the long term, our goal should be to grow our own coalition in the chamber by increasing support for our own ideologies in the Brazilian people in time for future elections. Having a larger allied coalition would reduce our dependency on the Centrão, and potentially enable us total dominance of the chamber."
 Brazil.20.a: "Unfortunately, we must partake in their political games."
 Brazil.21.t: "The Amazonian Jungle"
 Brazil.21.d: "Our North is covered by the world's largest jungle, the Amazonian Jungle. Nicknamed the \"Lungs of The World\", this massive green tapestry sees the equivalent of over two thousand soccer fields slashed and burned every day for logging, mining and agricultural activities, which have ramped up under Bolsonaro's presidency.\nWhile devastating it is a necessary evil in order to expand the economic activities our country relies in the most, the consequences of letting this process get out of control are also significant, not only in the climate impact but also in political capital.\nIn the short term, we should do what we can to counteract the rampant slashing and burning of the jungle. In the long term, we might be able to enact stronger reforms that will reduce or potentially even reverse the trend, albeit we should expect strong resistance from many lobbying groups against it."
 Brazil.21.a: "All this bother over some trees..."
 Brazil.22.t: "Lula da Silva's Condemnations Overturned"
 Brazil.22.d: "Lula was fully acquited and allowed to run for president again."
 Brazil.22.a: "This is looking to be an interesting election."
 Brazil.23.t: "Shifting our Focus Towards The Supreme Court"
 Brazil.23.d: "Xandão tá te vendo usando cheats pra passar à frente"
 Brazil.23.a: "Vossa Excelência provoca em mim os instintos mais primitivos."
 Brazil.24.t: "Trump Victorious in The US Elections!"
 Brazil.24.d: "Trump's re-election is not only being celebrated by Republican voters in the US, but also by Bolsonaro's own voting base as well as the Brazilian president himself. Almost immediately after the results were confirmed, Bolsonaro called Trump in order to congratulate him on his victory. The Brazilian president is expected to attend the inauguration next January with his family.\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has also taken the opportunity to talk directly to his followers in one of his presidential streams, affirming that Trump's election is proof that traditional values and hard work are what makes a country great, and that he expects great co-operation between the two nations in the near future. The president then ended the stream on a note of ensuring that, just as Trump's project for the US was given the chance to continue, so should his project for Brazil."
 Brazil.24.a: "The Americans have made the right choice. Here's hoping the Brazilians do so too."
 Brazil.25.t: "Biden Victorious in The US Elections!"
 Brazil.25.d: "While all across Brazil, the left is celebrating Biden's triumph against Trump in the recent US elections, the mood is somber in the Palácio do Planato. Bolsonaro had put a lot of his political credit behind Trump's campaign hoping it would pay off in the near future, and yet his candidate, the one representing all he had been fighting for, had lost.\nIt was said that whatever happens in American politics soon follows in Brazil, and Bolsonaro was very much aware of the opposition to his administration growing stronger. But this was no time to dwell on it. There was much to learn from the failures of Trump's campaign. And in the worst case scenario, he had his contingency plan to fall back on.\nBolsonaro wondered if it would be wise to phone Biden and congratulate him on his victory, as was tradition, but he decided against it. It would only rally up his political rivals more and seem like an admittal of defeat."
 Brazil.25.a: "No comment."
 Brazil.26.t: "Formation of The \"Brazilian Popular Front\""
 Brazil.26.d: "It seems that the Brazilian far-right are not the only extremists rallying up for the upcoming elections. Calling itself the \"Brazilian Popular Front\", the newly-announced far-left coalition claims to unite the multiple communist and radical socialist parties across the country, including members of PSOL, PCB, PCR, PCdoB and even the black sheep of the movement, PCO.\nThe initiative came from Popular Unity, a self-proclaimed revolutionary socialist party. UP president Léo Péricles formalized the coalition today, describing it as a \"response to the regime of death wrought by Bolsonaro and his allies\" and promising a \"real, tangible socialist plan for the nation\".\nWhile the Brazilian left seems to have rejoiced in this unexpected display of political unity, others have scoffed at the display, calling it an \"union of midget parties\" and dismissing it as a relevant political force. Still, many point out to this act as yet another sign of Brazil's rising political radicalization and division."
 Brazil.26.a: "Unity between leftists? Crazy world."
 Brazil.27.t: "Lula da Silva Announces Presidential Campaign"
 Brazil.27.d: ""
 Brazil.27.a: "But would the Brazilian people want him back?"
 Brazil.28.t: "Popular Front Backs Lula da Silva"
 Brazil.28.d: "Brazilian Popular Front leader Léo Péricles has announced today their support for presidential candidate Lula da Silva in the upcoming elections. Péricles has stated that \"revolutionary belief should not override pragmatism\", and that the coalition is confident Lula can be trusted to carry out a socialist project for the country, within the capabilities afforded to him as president of Brazil.\nThe decision came at no surprise to the majority of Brazilians, albeit it has been met with some backlash from the more radical left who expected the Popular Front to run against PT, at least initially. Many analysts and online commenters have pointed out the fact that the Popular Front lacks the strength to compete against any of the candidates as an untold reasoning for the decision.\nWhile this seems to be a bucket of cold water on the revolutionaries' hopes, the coalition has reaffirmed its commitment to radical socialist and communist ideals regardless of the outcome of the elections, and has warned Lula that \"our support comes with demands\". Lula's campaign has yet to respond to this development."
 Brazil.28.a: "Pragmatism wins again."
 Brazil.29.t: "The Covid-19 Parliamentary Inquiry Comission"
 Brazil.29.d: "Covid trials begin"
 Brazil.29.a: "Let's all hope for a fair trial."

 Brazil.58.d: "The instability wrought by the Second American Civil War seems to have finally reached our half of the continent, as large-scale armed confrontation has broke out in Colombia following a military coup against Gustavo Petro. The mood at Itamaraty has been frantic as diplomats and other foreign affairs workers have shown a lack of preparedness in how to handle with a conflict of such proportions at Brazil's doorsteps. Should we interviene? Or restrict ourselves to sending foreign aid? Offer asylum to Petro? Wait for the conflict to wind down?\nMany are also concerned about the integrity of Brazil's own government, as the same ideological divisions, political radicalization and crumbling establishments that led to the conflicts in the US and Colombia are present in Brazil. Right now, the consensus seems to be that we must ensure we can get through our own elections and avoid a similar fate before considering any sort of aid or intervention."

 Brazil.78.d: "During a press conference at the Palácio da Alvorada last evening, president Jair Bolsonaro was asked about the Covid-19 situation in the country and whether Brazil could see a scenario similar to the US, which has become the country with the most Covid-19 cases in the world amidst ongoing political instability. The president dismissed such concerns, claming that \"many Brazilians have already been infected and thus acquired antibodies, which helps this thing to not spread\". The president also said \"Brazilians must be studied, they can't catch anything, you'll see a guy jump in sewage and nothing will happen to him\".\nThe statement has proven controversial between supporters of the president and those concerned about the pandemic situation."

 Brazil.79.t: "Bolsonaro Speaks To Press as Covid Deaths Rise"
 Brazil.79.d: "As the Covid-19 death toll rises in Brazil, president Jair Bolsonaro was asked by a journalist about the number of casualties, responding \"hey man, I'm not a gravedigger, alright?\". This came after other statements made by the president to similar questions, that \"everyone dies someday\" and that Brazilians must \"man up\" if they wish to fight the virus.\nTo many, this statement comes in very bad taste as the number of deaths to Covid reaches the thousands."

 Brazil.80.d: "Bolsonaro has worked with his health ministry in order to push for an \"experimental\" chloroquine-based treatment against Covid-19. While the president has pushed for unrestricted usage of the substance, he admitted that it might prove innefective against Covid-19 in the future, but that it is a risk he'd rather take.\nBolsonaro has reassured that nobody will be forced to be medicated with the substance, calling it a \"democratic\" treatment. He also joked \"those on the right take chloroquine, those on the left, Tubaína\"."
 Brazil.80.a: "Hey, at least it's not horse medicine."
 Brazil.81.t: "President Criticizes Vaccine Efforts"
 Brazil.81.d: "\"Those who join the vaccine pile, and only the vaccine pile, are useful idiots\" - said Bolsonaro during one of his livestreams to his followers. \"When I offered medications back then, folk struck back\". These statements were made as early trials of Brazil's own Covid-19 vaccine, named Coronavac, have entered early trials. The prototype is being developed in conjunction with Chinese pharmaceutical companies by the Butantã Institute.\nMeanwhile, Bolsonaro has also talked about a potential virtual meeting with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in order to address the importation of an experimental anti-cancer spray that, according to the president, could help against Covid-19."
 Brazil.81.a: "The vaccines are turning people into alligators!"
 Brazil.82.t: "Bolsonaro Points To Budget Amidst Covid Outbreak"
 Brazil.82.d: "As Covid-19 infections and deaths soar in Brazil, president Jair Bolsonaro has stated in a talk to his supporters that Brazil is \"broke\" and that he could not do anything. The president has blamed Covid-19 for the situation the country is currently in, and also pointed fingers at the media for allegedly blowing it out of proportion. \"Chief, Brazil is broke, chief. I can't do anything. I wish I could tweak the income tax tables, then you got this virus\", the president stated.\nAccording to the health ministry, Brazil is close to reaching 200 thousand deaths from Covid, one of the worst curves of the pandemic seen in any country. While vaccine trials are underway, it seems that there's no relief for the Brazilian people in the near future."
 Brazil.82.a: "Maybe check the junk folder for any vaccine deals at this point?"
 Brazil.83.t: "Outburst During Presidential Statement!"
 Brazil.83.d: "With the daily death toll reaching new highs, things have gotten heated during a recent presidential TV statement as Bolsonaro lashed out at the criticism to his Covid-19 handling. \"Enough sissiness, enough crying!\", the president shouted at the audience. Bolsonaro also attacked those who demand the government purchase vaccines, calling them \"idiots\".\nThe statement comes in bad taste as even the president's own supporters have started to question his ability to manage the pandemic. However, a die-hard sect remains, trusting the presidents methods and questioning the real extent of the outbreak."
 Brazil.83.a: "Will he ever shut up?"
 Brazil.84.t: "Bolsonaro Is Covid-19 Positive!"
 Brazil.84.d: "The president's administration has confirmed today that Jair Bolsonaro has been diagnosed with Covid-19. While this has come as a shock to many of his supporters, the opposition and even some of his allies seem unphased by the news, pointing out the many times Bolsonaro ignored Covid guidelines and has gathered with his followers. To many, it's been a miracle that he didn't catch it earlier.\nThe president's state is stable, and he will remain in office, working virtually. Bolsonaro is expected to make a full recovery in a few weeks. Rumours around the presidential palace are that Bolsonaro has secretly gotten himself vaccinated during the early Coronavac trials, even though the president has consistently belittled vaccination as a preventative measure against Covid. Regardless, this development marks the culmination of Bolsonaro's covid policy, or lack thereof."
 Brazil.84.a: "Vaso ruim não quebra."
 Brazil.85.t: "Our Options Regarding The Oil Crisis"
 Brazil.85.d: "The impacts of the Saudi Oil Crisis on the Brazilian society have been left unchecked for over a year. While the Brazilians have managed to adapt to their current conditions, the combined effect of the oil crisis and coronavirus pandemic have taken their toll and the people are demanding action from our administration.\nOur main weapon against this crisis is the Brazilian oil company Petrobrás. It is a mixed-capital enterprise, open to private investors but with an enforced majority government share. Many financial elites and members of the centrist political wing have suggested we shift Petrobrás into a more open-capital enterprise, which would make it much more attractive to private investors. The gains from the added capital could then be paired with negotiations with Russian oil companies, allowing for a swift return to normalcy.\nHowever, politicians at both ends of the spectrum have argued we take a more autarkic route by tightening our grip on Petrobrás and investing heavily in bolstering our fuel refining facilities, aiming towards complete fuel self-sustainability. It would incur heavy costs in advance and take longer to bear fruit, but would pay off more in the long term."
 Brazil.85.a: "Our options are there. Time for action."
 Brazil.86.t: "Our Covid Recovery Plan"
 Brazil.86.d: "The Brazilian people have suffered under covid-19 for far too long. The chamber, senate and executive have been working together in drafting a plan towards full eradication of the pandemic and recovery, and thus far two camps have formed.\nThe deputies in the chamber believe that the best course of action would be to maintain the current \"local autonomy\" approach where measures are taken at the municipal and state level. This has the advantage of better tailoring policy towards the situation on the ground at every municipality, but also opens up the possibility of local ideologies to get in the way of recovery.\nMembers of the administration have suggested instead a federal plan to be enforced across the entire country. Having the power of the federal government would make these policies easier to enforce and be held to scrutiny, however we can also expect pushback as people across the country are currently disilusioned with the government's handling of the pandemic so far.\nFinally, the military has stepped in and proposed an alternative approach: Martial Law. It would allow for a swift recovery from both the pandemic and the political instability plaguing the country, but such an extreme measure would seem unwarranted unless the situation on the streets have really reached their lowest point. Key politicians have also warned that giving the military this much authority over the country could be risky."
 Brazil.86.a: "One way or another, we shall rid ourselves of this plague!"
 Brazil.87.t: "Military General in The President's Seat"
 Brazil.87.d: "With the ousting of Jair Bolsonaro from office, his Vice-President Hamilton Mourão has taken his place as the Brazilian succession of power dictates. Not only this makes this the second time in a row that a Vice-President has effectively took the president's office in Brazil, but Mourão's military background also makes him the first military officer to sit in the presidential seat since the dictatorship's end in 85.\nThe image of a general in office has elicited memories and fears of a return to the dark days of the military dictatorship in many Brazilians, but it has also rallied many who hold that era in high regard, with reactionary manifestations giving the go-ahead for an alleged military coup.\nSo far, Mourão has stated that he does not intend to govern as a general, but as a president. However he has also stated that \"given the extraordinary circumstances the Brazilian society finds itself in, unusual measures may be warranted\". While the controversial Jair Bolsonaro may be out, the new president seems to be leaving the Brazilian society more on edge than ever."
 Brazil.87.a: "Let's hope he keeps his promises."
 Brazil.88.t: "A Meeting With The High Command"
 Brazil.88.d: "\"Quite frankly, I had low expectations for martial law, but I suppose Brazilians are a meek people\". Members of the Brazilian high command had summoned the interim president Hamilton Mourão for a meeting behind curtains. Many of the Brazilian active generals were present, and knowing they were surrounded by fellow military men, many of them weren't afraid to speak their minds. \"And what about the so-called Captain? Is he gonna be causing any headaches?\", \"absolutely not. He's made for a great scapegoat for the media.\". Mourão Interjected: \"That doesn't mean we're in the clear though. Bolsonaro may be defeated, but we still have to deal with that ex-convict in the upcoming elections. You know the Brazilian people will fall for his rethoric hook line and sinker. And I would argue he's even worse than the failed Captain.\"\nThe room stood in silence for a few moments, until one officer spoke up: \"The Americans are busy going at each other's throats. The Europeans are too worried about Russia to look our way. We have the entire country on lockdown already. That's the opportunity of a lifetime! If we don't take this chance now, who knows when the next one will be\". Silence again. Mourão directed his tone at him: \"What are you proposing, general?\".\n\"That we take our country back, sir\"."

 Brazilnews.1.t: "Supreme Court Overturns Lula's Convictions"
 Brazilnews.1.d: "Brazil's Supreme Court minister Edson Fachin has overturned today all convictions imposed by the Federal Justice of Paraná on ex-president Luís Inácio Lula da Silva. The ex-president had been condemned on charges of corruption and money laundering in 2018 as part of Brazil's \"Car Wash\" anti-corruption investigations, which resulted in the suspension of his presidential campaign in the same year and his imprisonment. Fachin argued that there was not enough proof to form a conclusive case linking Lula to the fiscal irregularities that were under investigation, and also cited an abnormal assignment of judge Sérgio Moro to the case, who's been considered biased in the case. The overturn passed with 8 votes against 3 in the Supreme Court.\nLula, who had spent 580 days in prison and was released in early 2019 under claims of his arrest being inconstitutional, said in a press interview that he had always been certain of his innocence, that he was confident in the Brazilian process, and that \"the truth would win in the end\". The decision has proven controversial in Brazil's political and popular spheres, with many cheering the ex-president's release and claiming that justice has been done, while others condemn the decision and claim that Lula is still a criminal. Regardless, the decision restore Lula's political rights and means he would be allowed to run for the Brazilian office again."

Around 300 bodies of Covid victims have been laid to rest in an improvised mass grave in the middle of the jungle. According to local authorities, the deathcare systems in the municipality have been overburdened by the sudden spike in fatalities.\nLocal citizens have been appaled at the development as they witness their friends and family buried en masse. \"They were just dumped there like dogs\" - said local Gabriel de Oliveira, whose spouse contracted the disease during a hospital procedure - \"What are our lives worth now?

 Brazilnews.4.d: "With around 98% of votes tallied in the recent Brazilian 2022 general elections, Worker's Party candidate Luís Inácio Lula da Silva has been certified as the newest president elect of Brazil. This marks a historic moment in the country's political history, as Lula is the first Brazilian to be elected thrice as president. Reactions in the country have been split, with more progressive-minded Brazilians feeling ecstatic about their victory over the incumbent right-wing administration.\nIn a speech to his voters, Lula has thanked them and stated that his administration would see a return to the values of social democracy that led to Brazil's ascension in the 2000s and reaffirming that he cared for every Brazilian, regardless of ideological alignment.\nOn the other side of the aisle however, reactionary citizens and politicians have thus far refused to concede the results, claming that the electronic voting machines used in the elections were targeted by hackers in order to switch votes to Lula. Local analysts have expressed concern over the reaction to the elections, pointing to the ongoing crisis in the United States and warning of a possible similar development happening in Brazil."

 Brazilnews.5.d: "The recent general elections in Brazil have resulted in a major upset, as centrist candidate Geraldo Alckmin has been confirmed winner, marking the return of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party to power after two decades. This has come as a shock to both many Brazilians and international observers, as all signs pointed to it being a fierce contest between progressives and reactionaries, with PSDB candidate Alckmin expected to maintain a solid third place.\nWhile analysts believe this could represent a desire of the Brazilian people to stay away from more extreme politics in an ever more unstable world, some also point out at Alckmin's connections with the Brazilian establishment and media conglomerates as a major force behind his campaign and subsequent victory.\nAlthough the majority of Brazilians seem content with this result, those at the fringes have refused to concede defeat, accusing Alckmin's campaign of being unfairly backed by Brazilian elites and engaging in corrupt tactics in order to win. The international community has expressed concern with this development, as it could mirror the recent US political crisis that resulted in a continental civil war in the country."

 Brazilnews.6.d: "As the general elections in Brazil come to a close, it has been confirmed that incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro has secured his re-election. The right-wing conservative has had a troubled last two years in office, as Covid-19 ravaged Brazil, paired with the effects of the international oil crisis and also accusations of conspiracy. This culminated in 2021's \"Covid Trials\", where Bolsonaro was put to trial.\nHowever, the elections have proven that these events did little to damage Bolsonaro's or the right's reputation in the country, as the Brazilians have chosen for the continuation of his administration. In a speech to his followers, Bolsonaro proclaimed that he intends to make up for lost time and finish the project he started in 2018.\nOn the progressive side of Brazilian politics, accusations have been flung towards Bolsonaro wielding administrative powers to supress voters, specially in areas known to vote frequently for the Worker's Party. Analysts warn of a potential sucession crisis not unlike what has been witnessed in the US leading up to a complete civil war."

 BRA_systemic_corruption_idea: "Systemic Corruption"
 BRA_systemic_corruption_idea_desc: "Every Brazilian knows that since they were born, they were governed by a corrupt ruling class. While political corruption is nothing new under the sun for pretty much every country on Earth, Brazil's corruption appears to have taken deep roots throughout the whole of society, from the top politicians and billionaires all the way to small businesses and working class individuals. The so called \"Brazilian Way\" has led to a society with a poor moral compass, and although there are disagreements on how, everyone agrees that it must be dealt with."

 BRA_not_world_power_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_BRA_power_of_the_future\n\n\n\n\n\nEver since the turn of the millennium, Brazil has been referred to as the \"country of the future\" countless times. Thanks to the commodities boom of the 2000s, the country saw significant economic and social improvements and was even able to weather the 2008 depression, but all good times eventually come to an end. With the boom tapering off in 2014, economic and political crisis followed, and Brazil's dreams of becoming a superpower were put on hold. Some blame this on our own alleged shortsightedness and incompetence, while others accuse the international superpowers of subverting Brazil's interests, but one thing is certain: Within every Brazilian, there is a deep desire to see their nation finally take off and become the §H\"Country of the Future\"§! that was promised."

 BRA_mass_homicide_idea: "Mass Homicides"
 BRA_mass_homicide_idea_desc: "It's no secret that Brazil always finds itself at the very top of international homicide rankings. Warring criminal factions, a lack of effective policing and a particularly violent society are some of the usual culprits. Many solutions have been presented for this problem by the many political wings, from tougher policing to socio-educational reforms, but political inertia has led to mostly half-hearted attempts at best in the past."
 BRA_disjointed_geography_idea: "Disjointed Geography"
 BRA_disjointed_geography_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_BRA_disjointed_geography\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a post-colonial continental-sized nation in one of the most geographically-challenging parts of the world, Brazil is a poorly-interconnected country. The late 50s saw a push for automobile-centered infrastructure construction and the abandonment of the nation's railwail networks under president Juscelino Kubitschek. This infrastructure would prove difficult to build and maintain across the hilly terrains, deep jungles and marshes that make up the country, leaving pheripheral regions such as the Amazonian jungle poorly linked to the nation's central areas."
 BRA_agricultural_society_idea: "Agrarian Society"
 BRA_agricultural_society_idea_desc: "From colonial times to today, Brazil's economy has been mostly agrarian. The plantation lords of colonial times have been mostly replaced by large agricultural corporations nowadays, but many argue that the dynamic hasn't changed much between the two. A deep §Ragrarian reform§! or §Yindustrialization push§! would be essential in freeing Brazil from its agricultural dependency, but facing the strong opposing interests of these business sectors is a tough prospect for any politician."

Catholic Christians still hold a majority, but the last few decades have seen the steady rise of Evangelicals, who are set to become the dominant group this decade. This transition has been capitalized on by conservative and reactionary movements who preach for a return to traditional family and religious values, and was in great part responsible for the election of figures such as Jair Bolsonaro. This trend has also accompanied a rise in religious radicalization and the advent of \"megachurches\" in the country, which are often ran by celebrity pastors and accused of leeching funds from the common men and women."
 BRA_self_indulgent_military_idea: "The Brazilian Army"
 BRA_self_indulgent_military_idea_desc: "Considering that Brazil endured two decades under harsh military rule with more than its fair share of corruption, censorhip and torture, Brazil's military has gotten away with naught but a slap in the wrist. The Amnesty Law of 79 shielded officers from their crimes, and the military as a whole never saw any sort of institutional repercussion or reform as a consequence, with the post-military regimes instead opting to sweep everything under the rug and let bygones be bygones.\nThis led to the Brazilian high command becoming complacent and self-indulgent over the years, enjoying a plethora of perks and soft control over the nation's politics. Not only this leads to inflated costs, but also a less than competent cohort equipped with outdated hardware. It is a common joke in Brazilian society that our military is only ever good for painting curbs.\nAs the future of the world becomes more and more uncertain, we would be wise in reforming our military instutitions lest we get caught unprepared in a major conflict."

Our high command is threatening a mutiny, and are spreading this sentiment to our soldiers through ideologically-charged fearmongering. Our civilian population on the other hand has had an overwhelmingly positive response to these reforms, enough to force the army to not get any ideas for the time being.

While this allows our population to stay afloat even under a shrinking job market, these forms of work seldom pay enough to comfortably cover the cost of living, forcing these individuals to either take on multiple jobs at once or take on debts just to sustain themselves.

 #Summary
 BRA_country_summary: "§YCountry Summary§!:\nThe biggest economy in Latin America, and the second largest economy in the Americas only below the behemoth that is the US, Brazil has always been viewed as a nation full of potential. Unfortunately, that's all that there has ever been - potential. Coming out of WW2 with a craving for republicanism and development, Brazil had its ambitions cut short in 1964 when the military took over its institutions and enacted two decades of oppression.\nAs the military regime thawed, Brazil would once again dare to dream in the new millennium powered by a commodities boom wrought by the rise of new emerging powers. But this dream would again escape Brazil's grasp when the boom ended and with it Brazil's economic and political stability, culminating in the 2016 impeachment of president Dilma Roussef and a reactionary shift with Jair Bolsonaro.\nWith the entire world at the brink, the nation faces tough challenges ahead, but also plenty of opportunities. Could this finally be the time for Brazil to rise up and become the power of the future it has always craved to be?"
