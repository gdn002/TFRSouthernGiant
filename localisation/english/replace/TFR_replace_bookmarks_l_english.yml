 BM_HISTORY_TITLE: "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME: "Brave New World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As the world enters the 21st century, new facets of society begin to form. Political shifts begin as long-existing entities reach further and further from their initial scope. The internet's ability to broadcast any form of expression to the greater audience of the globe creates new pockets within society. New and old conflicts alike are pursued flagrantly and diligently across vast oceans and insignificant lines in the sand. Perhaps it is inevitable that the earth plunges into chaos, again. Perhaps the chaos itself is fleeting. In this world, only you may decide."
 FIRE_NAME: "§YLighting the Match§!"
 FIRE_NAME_DESC: "With the world coming out of the turbulent 2000's and the relatively quiet early 2010's, the world seems ready for its greatest upset since 1991. With the re-election of the anti-establishment Donald Trump fast approaching, looming tensions in both Eastern Europe and Asia along with extremism flaring up in every corner of the globe; the world's forecast already seems bleak and with disturbing reports of a 'novel coronavirus' brewing in China, it seems a match has been lit for this world spanning powder keg."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The European Union is more unpopular than ever before. The British people are quick to blame everything wrong with their country on the officials in Brussels, as well as on the German government in Berlin. The population is deeply split around this one particular issue. Britain has recovered from the economic crisis of 2008 well, but leaving the European Union might destroy the economic progress of the past decade. And even then... is national sovereignity not preferable to minor economic gains?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "France has suffered from economic hardship and from major terrorist attacks in Paris. The French people grow increasingly antagonistic to their muslim and jewish minorities. The Front National is looking at a possibility to perhaps take power in these troubled times. Will the democratic establishment and French European integration prevail? Or will France stand on her own like in the good old days?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Germany, hit by refugee crisis, economic hardship and growing internal resentment to countries like Greece, Italy and Spain, is still going strong. The European Union ever expands southwards. The European neighbors grow increasingly annoyed at Germany's policies. Is it worth it to continue that path? Or is it perhaps the time to revive border conflicts of old and let the soldiers march again?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Japan is faced with the possibility of war each passing day, as Chinese naval vessels aggressively close into the Senkaku Islands and as North Korean missiles are launched into the stratosphere. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution has recently been amended to allow for a more active Japanese military abroad. This militaristic stance is unpopular with the people, but perhaps necessary to maintain the national security."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "No country of the G7 and the great four of Europe has been so strongly affected by the economic crisis of 2008 like Italy has. Recovery is slow and government support dwindling. The influx of African migrants is not helping at giving the people the image of internal stability. Italy needs to consider her choices. Surely this is not the time to revive imperialism, but drastic reforms will be necessary..."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "China is very focussed on not letting her enemies not her weaknesses. Pollution, internal migration problems, a dwindling standard in the military, the ever corrupt governing body of the Communist Party. And yet, China is the giant of the east, the one that all the small countries fear. Japan, South Korea, the rebels in Taiwan, Vietnam... all of them united in their hatred for China. It is time for China to find a meaningful answer."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "India's economy is rapidly growing, and so is its population. Still not greatly in the international spotlight, the Tiger is well-fed and growling. India is on the hunt, and its prey ever-so unsuspecting."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Like other Southern European countries, Spain has fallen into economic crisis in 2008, requiring economic stimuli from Northern European economies. Podemos and Ciudadanos have brought a new populism and new uncertainty to the old political system, while Catalonian independence movements are more threatening to Spanish unity than ever.\n\nEconomic Recovery will be a long and rocky path - will Spain stay with Europe and stick to the agreements that prevent immediate disaster - or is the future of Spain a different one from the future of Northern Europe?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Kicked out of the G8, faced with massive economic sanctions, struggling with maintaining its sphere of influence, but at least reunited with its brethren on Crimea. That about sums up the situation of the Russian Federation since March of 2014. With the west now greatly antagonistic to Russia, it must consider either apologizing and retreating into its internationally acknowledged territory or it must find new allies. Beijing comes to mind."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Internally more divided than ever before, externally more challenged than any time since the Cold War ended. The United States is not living in a national golden age for sure. People are wary of Chinese aggression, of industrial problems and economic hardship, public support for American military alliances is fading. The next president of the United States will have to redefine what it means to be the greatest nation on earth, the land of the free and the home of the brave."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Once heralded as \"The Country of the Future\", it seemed that history had other plans for Brazil. The end of the commodities boom in 2014 was followed by financial crisis and a swift end to PT's strong grip on the country. The country would then see a complete reactionary shift, but after four years it seems that the nation has been left adrift with no plan or strategy for it in place. If Brazil is to live up to its hype it must decide on a path forward, or risk being left behind in history."
