 integralism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Ideology_Fascist\n\n\n\n\n\n§YClassical Fascism§! is the original fascist ideology as developed in Italy by Giovanni Gentile and Benito Mussolini. Classical Fascism is rooted in nationalism, corpratism and the desire of territorial expansion and imperialism. Classical Fascists promote a corporatist economic system whereby employer and employee syndicates are linked together in associations to collectively represent the nation's economic producers and work alongside the state to set national economic policy. This economic system intended to resolve class conflict through collaboration between the classes, in contrast to Socialism, Strasserism or National Bolshevism, which encourages conflict between the classes. Classical Fascism also denounces liberalism, especially classical liberalism, which Fascist leaders denounced as 'the debacle of individualism'."
