 #Ideas
 BR2_rural_economy_idea: "The Agrarian Heartland"
 BR2_rural_economy_idea_desc: "While we are fortunate to control parts of Brazil that are very aligned to our ideology and willing to fulfill their patriotic duty, the lands of central Brazil are mostly agrarian with few industrial centers under our command. We must act fast and secure the manufacturing hubs of Brazil, or risk being starved out!"
 BR2_martial_law_idea: "Indefinite Martial Law"
 BR2_martial_law_idea_desc: "What started with riots in the Federal District has developed into a nation-wide uprising, with an illegitimate government in the Southeast, insurrections to the North and Northeast, and even independence movements in the South. As a response, we have enacted round-the-clock martial law in all of our controlled territories until this crisis can be dealt with."
 BR2_constitutional_crisis_idea: "Constitutional Crisis"
 BR2_constitutional_crisis_idea_desc: "The Brazilian army reserves the right to guarantee law and order when the government fails to do so. While we have attempted to remain within the so called \"four lines of the constitution\", we also cannot jeopardize our mission for the sake of upholding an antiquated and collapsing status quo. Still, there are many who will attempt to use this fact to delegitimize the military and prevent us from fulfilling our duty."
 BR2_trigger_happy_military_idea: "Trigger-Happy Military"
 BR2_trigger_happy_military_idea_desc: "Our soldiers are eager to finally have their combat prowess tested, albeit not so much to be doing so against their fellow countrymen. While the sentiment is good in principle, our troops hold a romanticized view of their duty that not always aligns with the realities in the battlefield. Pair that with a high command that, with all due respect, lacks actual competency, we have our work cut out for us."
 BR2_operation_ustra_idea: "OPERAÇÃO: USTRA"
 BR2_operation_angico_idea: "OPERAÇÃO: ANGICO"
 BR2_operation_selva_idea: "OPERAÇÃO: SELVA"
 BR2_operation_apocalipse_idea: "OPERAÇÃO: APOCALIPSE"
 BR2_brazilian_army_unleashed_idea: "Brazilian Army Unleashed"
 BR2_brazilian_army_unleashed_idea_desc: "Now or never, the might of the Brazilian army will be put to the test! Our soldiers have been trained, our high command has put in the work in devising plans and strategies, all that's left is to put it to the test. §GSELVA!§!"
